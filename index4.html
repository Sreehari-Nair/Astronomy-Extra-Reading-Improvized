        <p><b>Water is the building block of life. Whole human civilisations arose from and around a stream of water. Life started as single cellular organisms inside water. Water is the place where fish exists. If fish was not there, there wouldn't have been boats, if there
        wouldn't have been boats then it would have taken longer to discover new lands for humans. So, overall it will be a disaster for every living organism in planet Earth if there was no water. Water is a element having two hydrogen one oxygen atom in it. Here is a picture about its elements. </b></p>
