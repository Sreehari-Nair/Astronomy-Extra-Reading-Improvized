        <p id="parahead"><b>Why moons?</b></p>
        <p>Ok, I know this may sound stupid but a moon big enough to the planet's size will help evolution of life. If the moon has a stable orbit 
            around its parent planet, then the moon will try its best to hold the planet's axis into one proper place if it is big enough. Why, we may
            ask, but that helps in  normal season formation, if the Earth didn't had a moon, one day polar bears would say, "Oh! Here is a rainforest we
            can enjoy" or the fishes will say, "Here is the Sarhara desert we can see.", Well... we don't want that, so, it is a neccesity that we 
            have a big enough moon around our exoplanet. We will talk about some exoplanets and why it is special in the next page! </p>
