            Atmosphere is a very essential part of our lives, it helps us to
            breathe, keeps our body intact with the help of gravity and is a very
            essential part for human survival , now in the previous page, we
            talked about the composition of the atmosphere. Now, it is very
            specific number because the Carbon-Dioxide traps heat radiated by the
            Sun to ensure a warm climate so naturally, we don't need a huge amount
            of it in our atmosphere. When we see sattelite images of the Earth
            which we will show is the Nitrogen fo the atmosphere, it feeds the
            plants that feed us food and consists of 70% of the Earth's
            atmosphere. And finally, Oxygen, the breath of life, our body breathes
            Oxygen and Nitrogen and use it for energy, well that is biology and we
            are not here to speak biology. See you in the next page!!
